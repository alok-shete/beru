 * A custom hook that subscribes to a store and allows selecting a slice of state, with optional actions, using a selector function.

 * @template TState - The type representing the shape of the store's state.
 * @template TActions - The type representing the actions of the store. Default is `Record<string, unknown>`.
 * @template TSelected - The type representing the selected slice of state. Default is `TState & TActions`.
 * 
 * @param {Store<TState> | StoreWithActions<TState, TActions>} store - The store object to subscribe to, which can either be a basic store or a store with actions.
 * @param {Selector<TState & TActions, TSelected>} [selector] - A function to select a slice of the storeâ€™s state. Defaults to selecting the entire state.
 * @returns {TSelected} - The selected slice of state.
